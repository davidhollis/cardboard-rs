# cardboard

A command-line utility for rapidly prototyping board and card games _[, eventually!]_

## Developing

There's not much here yet, but it's relatively vanilla Rust: any development environment that's capable of working with cargo should be just fine. To get started:

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```
